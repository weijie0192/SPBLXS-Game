        <h1>Game Information</h1>

        <h3> Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose for this game is to survive and kill as many enemies as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Player Health</h3>
        <p>
            The player's health is represented as the red bar at the top right corner of the window. The bar
            will decrease if the player takes damage. Also the health will regenerate at a rate of 1. If the bar fully
            depletes to zero the player will die and the game will stop.
        </p>
        <h3>Energy/Shield</h3>
        <p>In this game we make use of energy. The energy is represented as the cyan bar at the top right corner of the
            window, below health bar.
            When the game starts the energy bar will decay at a rate of 1.
            The Energy can be used as a shield. You can activate the shield by pressing the T key.
            While the shield is active, when enemies shoot you it will deplete the shield instead of your health. Also,
            while you have the shield active it will decay faster at a rate of 6. The shield will take 6-time the damage
            . Firing the guns and creating a block will also consume energy.
            The energy will not regenerate like the player's health, to regain energy the player must kill enemies and
            destroy blocks.
        </p>
        <h3>Jump fuel</h3>
        <p>
            Jump fuel is represented as a purple bar at the left bottom hand corner of the screen, going vertically up.
            With jump fuel the player will be able to jump long distances. When the jump fuel depletes the player will
            only be able
            to do a regular jumps until the jump fuel regenerates. The jump fuel will only regenerate when the player is
            on the ground.
        </p>
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <p>
            Use W,A,D keys to move your character around. W key to jump up, the A key to move right, and the D key to
            move right.
            You can also press the spacebar to jump up. The can also dig down/destroy blocks with the mouse scroll
            button. The player can
            place blocks with the mouse right click.
        </p>
        <h3>Weapons</h3>
        <p>
            In this game you have to two weapon types, the rifle and the sniper. The rifle fires fast
            but does little damage. The sniper fires slow but does high damage and high penetration. When the game
            starts, the default
            weapon is the rifle. You can change weapons by pressing the E and Q keys, the E key to change to sniper and
            the Q key to change
            back to the rifle. You can also use the mouse to click the rifle and sniper buttons at the bottom of the
            screen to change weapons.
            Use the mouse left click to fire your weapon.
        </p>
        <h3>Enemies</h3>
        <p>
            There is three enemy types in the game the ground enemies, the flying enemies, and the boss.
            Ground enemies spawn five seconds into the game. Flying enemies spawn one hundred seconds into the game.
            The boss spawns one-hundred fifty seconds into the game. The boss has 3 weapon types whereas the ground and
            flying
            enemies only have one.
        </p>
        <h3>More Interface</h3>
        <p>
            The score, survive time and the number of enemies is displayed at the top right below the health and energy
            bar.
            The score increases with the amount of enemies killed. The survive time increases the longer you live. The
            number of enemies decrease as enemies are killed
            and increases as they spawn.
        </p>
        <h3>Map size</h3>
        <p>
            In the beginning, when the program starts you can set map size to be small, medium , or larger. On default
            the map size is at medium.
            Keep in mind the larger the map size the more memory it will consume, your fps will be lower.
        </p>
        <h3>ScoreBoard</h3>
        <p>
            The ScoreBoard will show the top ten players based on the score or enemies killed. After the player dies the
            score, the survive time, and the players name will uploaded to the server then sent back to the scoreboard
            to be displayed. </p>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>
            Build blocks around yourself for defense, so the enemies hit the blocks around you instead of you. Also you
            can dig to avoid enemies, this is a good
            defense measure as well.Though, when the boss spawns, digging won't help you in fact it will hinder you. So
            stay above ground for the boss encounter. Keep in mind with the weapons the rife is easier to shoot but does
            less damage. While the sniper rife does more damage but it has a slow fire rate,
            so it will be harder to hit enemies. Also, only use shield if necessary because it will decay faster when
            active. When you die, your name, score, and survive time will be uploaded to the php server and sent back to
            the scoreboard. The score board will consist of the top 10 scores, so if you do well you will be legendary.
            Thank you for playing our game and good luck cause you are going to need it.
